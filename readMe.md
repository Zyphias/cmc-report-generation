### Logic

1. Program reads all CSV file from the CSV folder.
2. New objects are created for each Year and Student.
3. Each student object has their name, year, the period and their feedback (including comments).
4. From each student class, the program generates a pdf report.

Can be split into 2 parts:

1. Data extraction
2. Data visualization
